# C++ Kruskal's Algorithm

This is a simple C++ implementation of Kruskal's for finding the minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph.
It reads from a file called kruskal.in, which has on it's first line the amount of nodes and edges, and after, on each line it has the start node of the edge, the end node of it, and the weight for traversing that edge.
It then constructs and outputs the minimum spanning forest to a file called kruskal.out.
